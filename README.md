# Weather Application

It is a Weather Application built purely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have used an opensource api provided by openweathermap.org to acomplish this project. 

Link: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3

Steps to use the api:
1. Simply just write the name of the location in the search box and get the complete weather information of that particular area.

Do make sure to add some edits if you want to edit it.
